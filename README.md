# libcmor

This is a personal project to create a C library useful as a basis for future projects. It was partly inspired by the many features that .NET provides to developers in C# and templates in C++.

It is written as a header-based library, but it can be configured and built using CMake.

## Future Work

- Update CMakePresets.json to include well-known kits
- Rewrite QuickSort and MergeSort in C (long, then _Generic)
- Write a stack
- Write a queue
- Write a singularly-linked list
- Write a hash table
- Write a dictionary
- Write a binary tree
- Write an AVL tree
